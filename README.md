# Predictive Analytics and Modelling using Python
This is an incomplete Predictive Analytics and Modelling Project using Python on DVD Rental dataset.
The dataset is modelled using Dimentional Modelling technique using Star Schema which contains multiple dimension tables and a single fact table.

After simple data exploration, it can be concluded that the dataset is in a very bad shape which is not ideal for analytics.
